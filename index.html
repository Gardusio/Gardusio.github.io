        <h2>PROFILE</h2>
        <p>I am a software engineer with strong foundations in object-oriented programming, algorithms, data structures,
            databases, networking. I had to interrupt my academic journey during the COVID-19 pandemic, but this allowed
            me to gain valuable industry experience. I am now completing a master's degree in AI and Data Analytics,
            with the goal of helping shape the future through cutting-edge technology. Outside of work, I have a keen
            interest in sports, history, and outdoor activities, which keep me grounded and inspired. People usually say
            I'm easy to get along with.</p>

                <h3>Software engineer</h3>
                <p class="date">Ro Technology & Sky IT, Sep 2021 - Sep 2022</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Backend consultant at Sky IT. Developed microservices both from scratch and by refactoring
                        legacy
                        monoliths using Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, Jenkins, and AWS cloud services.
                    </li>
                    <li>Achieved a 20% reduction in response time on refactored microservices (measured with AWS
                        CloudWatch).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Software engineer</h3>
                <p class="date">Daje! Shop - Startup, Aug 2020 - Aug 2021</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I built a platform to manage the order lifecycle for customers, merchants, and admins by
                        integrating
                        Shopify with custom mobile apps and third-party ticketing systems.</li>
                    <li>Shortened the agreed time-to-market of related services by 25%: I had 4 months to build the
                        system but
                        delivered it in 3.</li>
                    <li>Reduced the time spent on ticket resolution by the Operations team by 75% - 1.5h/day instead of
                        5h/day.
                    </li>
                    <li>Increased the average number of daily fulfilled orders by merchants by 40%</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <h3>Web Developer</h3>
                <p class="date">Freelance, Feb 2022 - Mar 2024</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I helped small regional businesses with web applications and integrations, which funded my
                        Master's
                        studies.</li>
                    <li>Main technologies: Java, SpringBoot, JavaScript, ExpressJS, React, Python, AppScript, Google
                        APIs, and
                        Firebase.</li>
                    <li>Saved an average of 6k/year thanks to my code, as small regional businesses often don't need
                        expensive
                        third-party SaaS solutions.</li>
                </ul>
