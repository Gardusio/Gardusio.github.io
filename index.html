        <h2>PROFILE</h2>
        <p>I am a software engineer with strong foundations in object-oriented programming, algorithms, data structures,
            databases, networking. I had to interrupt my academic journey during the COVID-19 pandemic, but this allowed
            me to gain valuable industry experience. I am now completing a master's degree in AI and Data Analytics,
            with the goal of helping shape the future through cutting-edge technology. Outside of work, I have a keen
            interest in sports, history, and outdoor activities, which keep me grounded and inspired. People usually say
            I'm easy to get along with.</p>
